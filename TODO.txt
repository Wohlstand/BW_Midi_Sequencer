HMI support:
+ Local tracks loop
+ Branches ID and branch jumps
+ Track disabling per device
- Branch and loop end callbacks (will be possible to cancel loops or branch jumps!)
- Complete restore MIDI state on loop jump ()

XMI support:
- Implement support of multiple songs playing (put song specific stuff into dedicated structure, and have an array of loaded and currently-playing songs!)

EMIDI support:
- Implement the mode switching between generic and EMIDI behaviour (EMIDI specification conflicts with existing features set and heuristics would just ruin everything).
- Handle all EMIDI controllers according to EMIDI specification when EMIDI mode is toggled on, and generic behaviour should be ignored.
